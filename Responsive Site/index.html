                        I stream on Twitch. Not a lot to say. I play video games and let people laugh at me when I fail at them.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class = 'single-service'>
                    <img src = 'Images/placeholder.jpg'>
                    <p>
                        I also make YouTube videos. Not about video games, but about music. Specifically, I review albums and make countdowns and other stuff like that.

                        I have a Twitter account where I send updates about the aforementioned Twitch and YouTube channels. It's probably important to follow that one.

                        I have a Discord server too. I also post updates there, but with the added bonus of being able to talk with me directly!
